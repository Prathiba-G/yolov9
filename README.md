# YOLOv9 PDF Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a chatbot using Streamlit that interacts with users based on the content of a YOLOv9 PDF document. The chatbot utilizes Pinecone for vector storage, Hugging Face for embeddings, and a Google model for generating responses. The goal is to provide users with an interactive way to query information from the YOLOv9 PDF dataset.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user queries and provides relevant responses.
- **Vector Storage**: Uses Pinecone to efficiently store and retrieve document embeddings.
- **Embeddings**: Utilizes Hugging Face models to convert text into embeddings for similarity search.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly chat interface.
